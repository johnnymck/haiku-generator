Haiku Generator
================

Inspiration from "Impractical Python Projects" by Lee Vaughn

To generate a haiku, simply type `python haiku.py <model name>`

To generate a new text model, get a plaintext source from which to draw from ([say Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol in UTF-8 form from project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46/46-0.txt)) and type `python gen_name.py <source text filename> <output name>.p`

Sample outptut:
```
archways cut that speak
from the quails cruel autumn as
i have knocked you

warlord storm in the
wind at dusk nightingales
begin their psalm good!

a lovely sunset
hanging grapes wine for bees
and me eleven
```
Using Shakespeare's 'The Sonnets' as an input you may yield such outputs as
```
so! how are mine ransoms
parallels in thy fury
princesâ€™ favourites
```
Or with Robert Burns' 'Tam O Shanter':
```
bairns a foal lowping
sat auld and bear and styles
lassie she was vauntie ah!
```
