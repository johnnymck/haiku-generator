Haiku Generator
================

Inspiration from "Impractical Python Projects" by Lee Vaughn

To generate a haiku, simply type `python haiku.py <model name>`

To generate a new text model, get a plaintext source from which to draw from (say Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol in UTF-8 form from project Gutenberg) and type `python gen_name.py <source text filename> <output name>.p`
